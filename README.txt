INTRODUCTION
------------

Although the popularity and accessibility of ebooks are increasing, they can never replace the feel and touch of a physical book. BookSwitch aims to tap into the “exchange your books through our point system” functionality, allowing users to exchange their preloved books for points. It also has a search function to allow users to search for available copies of their favourite books. Hence, it is specifically made for avid readers who like to browse for books and get books without additional monetary investment.
